                                Welcome to my 'little' writing and role-playing project, Legends of Fae'Gir!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What I've got in my hands started as a personal practice to improve my web design skills, and wanting to mix it with something I'm passionate about, such as writing, I wanted to bring it into the world of role-playing, creating a completely open community. The word 'community' sometimes leaves a bad taste, but I simply want... us to have a 'hub', something that brings us together. We are all completely free to expand our characters wherever and however we want.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have ideas about a character you're excited to participate with, I invite you to join our community. Our imagination is the key to having a good time, and after all, if you're here, it's because you enjoy writing and role-playing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only <b>requirements</b> are that you use an <b>original character</b>, and I always try to give credit to the artists. <b>I emphasize that you can contribute to the story, as I want it to be something evolutionary</b>, even modifying the map if you simply like it or have any ideas, creating new cities, brotherhoods...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>If you want to join or have any questions, I'm always around here:</b>
                            </p>
