                                At the heart of the inhospitable Northern Marches rises the impenetrable fortress known as Frost Home.
                                This capital city, shrouded in a cloak of glacial cold, rarely opens its doors to outsiders, keeping its secrets
                                guarded within the protection of its high walls and towers.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                For the fortunate few who call this icy bastion home, Frost Home is a refuge amidst the brutal climate that ravages these lands.
                                Its inhabitants, hardened by the adversities of the north, find warmth and protection within the embrace of its walls.
                                However, for those who were not born amidst the icy breezes of the north, Frost Home reveals itself as a frigid hell,
                                where the inclemencies of the weather are as ruthless as the decisions one must make to survive.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                In this bastion of ice, survival is forged in the flames of resistance to the climate and hardships, creating resilient and
                                seasoned individuals who face both the plagues that ravage the land and the creatures that crawl from the lands beyond the north.
                                Frost Home, with its steely character and relentless environment, is a testament to the tenacity of those who have learned to dance
                                with the icy death that always lurks.
