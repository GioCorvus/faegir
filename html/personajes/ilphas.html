                                <h2>Prince Ilphas</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Ilphas carries the weight of Naos like it was stitched into his bones. Firstborn of the royal line, crown prince, and heir to a kingdom long shuttered from the world, he walks the line between tradition and expectation with practised ease. <br>
                                    Duty defines him. Every word, every decision measured against what will one day be his throne. He is the voice of reason among the five siblings, the calm against the storm. Yet even stone weathers, and behind the composure is a man who rarely lets himself breathe.
                                <p>
                                    He guards his younger siblings with quiet intensity, especially the youngest two, shielding them from most of the burdens he bore too young. But the second oldest, Daylor, tests his patience, all wild spirit and disregard, a contrast that leaves Ilphas biting down frustration behind closed doors. In truth, he needs his brother; this is a duty that weighs heavily on one's shoulders.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is love in him, though it’s often tucked away. His wife sees it in the rare softness of his voice. His infant son, in the still moments when the crown prince becomes only a father. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He is preparing himself for the crown, even if he doesn’t feel like he will ever truly be ready for it.
                                </p>
