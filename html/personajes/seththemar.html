                                <h2>Seth'Themar</h2>

                                <p>Seth’themar was born under the roar of a storm and the scent of ash, beside a funeral pyre where war-heroes were once burned. His mother died in childbirth, his father already lost to the last border clash. He had no lullabies, no cradles, and just counted with the distant ring of steel.</p>

                                <p>He grew up in the shadows of wars, watching warbands pass through like seasons. At twelve, he stole a bow from a drunken mercenary. At thirteen, he joined his first skirmish. By the age of fifteen, he had already led a successful defense of a border fort, outwitting a Dawnlands general twice his age.</p>

                                <p>He fought with charisma and precision, wielding a greatbow from the high ridges like an eagle diving from above. His tactics were bold, sometimes reckless, but they worked.</p>

                                <p>He developed a reputation as a roving warlord who refused titles and oaths, joining warbands only until their conquests bored him. A hero to some. A braggart to many. To Seth’themar, it was simple: glory was meant to be taken, and some said that the gods had marked him as the one who would take it.</p>

                                <p>Everything changed when he attempted to annex one of the very few known dwarven mountain holds left in the surface during a brutal spring campaign. Seth’themar had planned the siege flawlessly, using avalanches, starvation tactics, and encircling cavalry to pen the stout folk in. But he hadn’t accounted for her.</p>

                                <p>A dwarven warrior emerged alone from the gates. Cloaked in furs, sturdy as stone and quiet as snowfall, she scaled the narrow ledge above the siege line and challenged Seth’themar directly. Her name was Vorna.</p>

                                <p>The duel was short, brutal, and without elegance. Seth’themar fought like a storm, but Vorna endured. She bled from a gash along her flank, her shield shattered halfway through, yet still she broke through his guard and slammed him down hard enough to crack stone. His bow arm snapped beneath her boot, and his ribs followed.</p>

                                <p>And then, with blood in her teeth and one knee nearly giving out, she offered him a hand.</p>

                                <p>Not a word spoken. No smugness, but… A feeling of familiarity, on both ends. Like they knew each other. It was the first time Seth’themar had been defeated. And the first time someone else had earned his respect.</p>

                                <p>They spoke few words in the aftermath. None were needed. Something passed between them: Recognition.</p>

                                <p>So he stayed. Not to follow, not to lead, but to stand beside her. Two forces sharpened by war, drawn by something neither could name.</p>

                                <p>Some time after, they both felt it: a dream shared, vivid and undeniable. A relentless pull from beyond the known world. Far too real to ignore. And so, they followed, across scorched fields and roads, chasing the echo of three others who had yet to be found.</p>
