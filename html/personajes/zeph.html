                                <h2>Zeph, the Artist</h2>

                                <p>The underworld of Ebony City is a breeding ground for all kinds of creatures. Darkness and desolation seethe in every corner, giving rise to thieves, warriors, and assassins of mixed heritage.</p>

                                <p>From among them emerged a half-breed. Half-elf, half-human, with skin as pale as clouds and hair as white as snow. He possessed a rare kind of beauty that made him stand out amidst the prevailing decay of his surroundings. Yet, beyond his physical appearance, it was his gaze that bestowed upon Zephyr a mysterious air, which for some translated into outright danger.</p>
                                
                                <p>From as far back as he could remember, Zeph had been drawn to blood magic, an ancient form of sorcery coveted and hunted by many, deriving its power from the essence of blood itself. His magic manifested as reddish thorny blood vines, illuminated by a crimson tint that adorned the scenes as blood spilled. However, the most mesmerizing aspect of his magic was his ability to conjure roses from spilled blood, creating beautiful yet decadent scenes wherever his artistry was imposed.</p>
                                
                                <p>His beauty, his affinity for art, and his rare blessing with blood magic earned him a unique position in Ebony City's society. His presence did not go unnoticed, and his quirks and magic stirred whispers and gazes wherever he went. In the heart of the city, the half-breed began to attract the attention of dangerous figures threatening to unravel his destiny for something beyond his comprehension.</p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    With a shadow looming over him, and a great hunger to both expand his horizons and his art, Zeph eventually departed from the capital with the determination to satisfy said hunger. Unbeknownst to him, life beyond the familiar confines of the Zenith was far from ideal for people like him, and he would encounter challenges and revelations that would transform his understanding of both the world he left behind and the one he longed to explore.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    And yet, in time, he founded supernova group of The Wild Roses, yearning to expand those new horizons.
                                </p>

                            <p>Zephyr is a taciturn individual who exudes a great aura of enigma. Although his appearance suggests serenity, his penetrating gaze is laden with deep emotions and experiences that he carries on his shoulders even at a young age.</p>

                            <p>He manifests his creativity and love for art through his magic, with his ability to weave magic and blood into roses reflecting the duality that brews in his soul.</p>

                            <p>During his travels, both alone and alongside The Wild Roses, the white-haired half-elf has also shown himself to be extremely loyal and brave, but despite being blessed with a peculiar beauty and a romantic nature, he seems to have... a certain aversion to commitment.</p>
