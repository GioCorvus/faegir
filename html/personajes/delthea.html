                                <h2>Delthea, the Sharpshooter</h2>

                                <p>
                                    They called her Delthea, although she didn’t remember if that name was ever truly hers. The past was a hollow space, something that was not important to dwell on when you were slowly working on your greatness.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Among the Death Stalkers, she followed more than she led. She waited, watched, and mirrored the cruelties of her siblings when they acted first. If they deemed another unworthy, they were also unworthy in her eyes. Her envy was a quiet thing, festering behind smirks and side glances. She craved their strength, their place and the fact that their father had clear favourites amongst the members.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    She was a sharp eye in the dark, her arrows always finding their mark. Up close, she faltered. Her hands were made for string and fletching, not fists or knives. It often left her at a loss when it came to sparring with her sister, Naevys, often beaten with ease, often at the end of a disapproving scowl from her father. Despite her strength and expertise, she was the weakest of the bunch, and that meant she was the easiest to dispose of if a replacement was ever made.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    She has to get better, she must be better if her space within the Death Stalkers is to remain strong. There will be a time when she is deemed worthy in her father’s eyes.
