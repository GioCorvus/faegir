                                <h2>Eld'Ael</h2>


                                <p>
                                    Some time ago, a baby wrapped in bandages ended up at the doors of a convent in Verkkel's Hold. Just born,
                                     he already had dark hair as the night, and his pointed ears revealed he was an elf.
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    The child spent his early years in that place that sought to impart the values of the reigning gods into the
                                    outcast and abandoned children,
                                    but since he became conscious and was able to walk, the young elf was always drawn to the opposite
                                    of all those values. From bruises and cuts on other children, who refused to speak about who had
                                    caused them, to thefts and disappearing objects, to dead animals like wingless birds or broken mice.
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    The young elf, baptized Eld'Ael, didn't take long to leave the convent. His motivations and aspirations 
                                    drifted away from the environment in which he had grown up, and although he had been saved from the streets
                                    at birth, he jumped back into them as soon as he could: he didn't like the restraints, the shackles,
                                    and the limitations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There were people who stole to live. To get something into their stomachs. There were those who went
                                    further and filled their pockets by extorting others, and decisively... also with blood on their hands.
                                    But that young elf did it all, and not out of necessity. He did it for sport. Because he wanted to.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    He ended up joining The Shadows. It was a brotherhood of thieves, assassins, extortionists, and "hired swords"
                                    that had hideouts spread across cities beyond the Zenith. Within its ranks, Eld'Ael quickly stood out 
                                    for his skill and audacity, as well as for being a supernova willing to accept the most unpleasant and 
                                    darkest contracts without any hesitation. His ability to disappear into the shadows and his prowess with
                                    steel and subterfuge made him a valuable member for the brotherhood.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Over time, Eld'Ael rose through the ranks of the brotherhood, earning the respect and fear of those 
                                    around him: yes, he was a double-edged sword. Dangerous and unscrupulous, but effective and trustworthy.
                                    Years passed, and his name was whispered more and more, as doubts arose about the leadership ability of
                                    the current leader of The Shadows: Eld'Ael's ideas, ideals, and leadership skills were a better
                                    version in every sense.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The seed of doubt was finally sown, and although not everyone supported him, Eld'Ael's steel ultimately
                                     took his life, and the throne of The Shadows was occupied by the elf.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now, as the head of the brotherhood, the underworld of Fae'Gir resonates ever louder under the yoke
                                     of his influence.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    And it is only a matter of time before that influence oozes out of the shadows into the rest of the world.
                                </p>
