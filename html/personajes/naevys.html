                                <h2>Naevys, the Black Widow</h2>
                                <p>The Deathstalkers are not born; they are made. Shaped by pain, forged in blood, and bound by an unbreakable oath, Naevys has never known another life. Raised in servitude to the Unholy Triad, she was trained from childhood to kill in their name, stripped of weakness and reforged into something stronger. The transformation into a Deathstalker left its marks: her eyes turned red, her body scarred, but it did not erase everything. Beneath the discipline and control, she still burns with emotion. Rage fuels her strikes. Jealousy sharpens her instincts. She does not suppress these feelings; she wields them.</p>

                                <p>As one of the Triad’s most lethal assassins, Naevys executes espionage, sabotage, and assassination with unwavering precision. She is ruthless in her pursuit of success, willing to manipulate, deceive, and even cut down her own if they stand in her way. Yet despite her ambition, she holds a measure of camaraderie toward her fellow Deathstalkers. They are the only family she has ever known. But loyalty does not mean mercy. If forced to choose between her own survival and another’s, she will not hesitate.</p>
                                
                                <p>Her devotion to the Triad is absolute. There is no other path, no question of betrayal. To serve them is the only way, the only truth she has ever known. She does not dream of freedom or rebellion; such thoughts are for the weak. She was made into a weapon, and she will remain one until the day her usefulness runs out.</p>
                                
                                <p>In battle, Naevys moves like a shadow, striking fast and without warning. Her weapons of choice are twin daggers, quick and merciless, perfect for slipping between ribs or slicing a throat before her target even knows she is there. She does not take unnecessary risks, nor does she tolerate failure. Every mission is a step forward, every success another reminder of why she was chosen.</p>
                                
                                <p>The Deathstalkers have no place for doubt. No space for weakness. Naevys will not falter, because to falter is to fall, and she has never failed to land on her feet.</p>
