                                <h2>Vaelith</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Vaelith was born in a quiet coastal region of the Land of Dawns, a place where salt winds carried old superstitions and anything unexplained was best kept hidden. From a young age, she showed a relentless curiosity and a sharp tongue. Her dark hair shimmered with violet in the right light, her eyes an arresting shade of blue that always seemed to hold too many thoughts at once. She could be headstrong and even brash, but never unkind. Vaelith had a strong sense of justice and a softness she reserved for children and those who had no one else to defend them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She grew up close to her twin brother, Hendrik. They were inseparable. She was the outspoken one, he the quieter, steadier half of their bond. When they were barely into adulthood, a sudden accident claimed Hendrik’s life. Vaelith should have lost him forever, but something else happened. She absorbed his spirit. One moment she was clutching his lifeless body, the next she was hearing his voice, seeing flickers of him in reflections, shadows, and dreams. He wasn’t truly alive, not in any way she could explain, but he wasn’t gone either.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Terrified by this unnatural occurrence, Vaelith kept it secret. In the Land of Dawns, magic was feared, and anyone branded a mage was hunted or quietly removed. She fled her village soon after, carrying her grief and the ghost of her brother with her. For a while, she kept to quiet libraries, trading her skills as a scribe and translator in exchange for access to old texts. She became a scholar not out of ambition but necessity. If she could understand what had happened to her, she could learn to control it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Two years later, another spirit joined her. During a skirmish between soliders and raiders, Vaelith was caught in the fray. A dying soldier collapsed near her, and before she understood what was happening, she had absorbed him too. His name was Uhtred. Older than her, battle-worn and gruff, he manifested differently from Hendrik. In moments of danger, Uhtred’s spirit could be summoned to fight in her defence, his skills as a warrior undiminished even in death.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She didn’t choose these souls, didn’t know how to stop it or why they remained so tethered to her. She lives in quiet exile, travelling from town to town, searching libraries and ruins for knowledge that might explain her existence. She avoids attention, though her blunt honesty sometimes draws it anyway. Despite everything, Vaelith has not hardened. She remains someone who helps where she can, though she is careful never to let anyone see too much.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She is not a fighter in the traditional sense. Her magic is not elemental or visible. It is strange and heavy, and no one taught her how to wield it. The burden of carrying souls wears on her, especially Hendrik, whose presence she both cherishes and mourns. Vaelith is still learning, still afraid of what she might become, but she refuses to stop looking for answers.
                                </p>
