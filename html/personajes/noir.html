                                <h2>Noir</h2>

                                <p>Nowadays, no one remembers the moment Noir was born, like a page missing from a book. It happened in a remote village, small, self-reliant, tucked between the borders of the Zenith. Rumors say that the night before, the stars dimmed. Every light turned inward. And when the sun rose, it was painted a horrifying shade of violet.</p>

                                <p>Cultists came in the dark, zealots of some long-forgotten creature they revered as a god. They sought a stillbirth for a ritual. Of course, they had to cause the stillbirth.</p>

                                <p>There was a woman. Already in labor. They did all the work: despoiled the moment, invaded the house, stole the reins of the birth.</p>

                                <p>When the knife was raised, when breath caught and the blade hovered above her throat, something happened. Silence followed. Not eerie. Just the sudden absence of all things.</p>

                                <p>A newborn lay bare on the bed. A child that didn’t even cry. Around him, where people once were, only their silhouettes remained: perfect outlines scorched into stone and planks of wood. The cultists. The priest. The midwife. The woman. All gone.</p>

                                <p>Just a blink. And the world had less in it.</p>

                                <p>The child had no name. No one claimed him, they were scared. But he refused to die.</p>

                                <p>They saw him through gray stained windows. Eventually, empathy overcame fear. They began to feed him. When he started to walk, they left food by the door, though rarely did anyone approach. In time, he became a part of the village. They said his eyes were wrong, not lifeless, but void, like spoiled light.</p>

                                <p>He didn’t speak until he was eight. Didn’t laugh until long after. Sometimes, when he stood still long enough, he heard things: a growl and the snarling voice of something under the floorboards or behind the cracks in the walls. People said they could feel a shadow walk beside him. That he often looked at empty corners as if something looked back.</p>

                                <p>By sixteen, he left. Just walked away. No one saw him go, but afterward, something in the town felt missing. Even those who feared him admitted it felt hollow without him, like he’d been a plug in some wound they never noticed.</p>

                                <p>He became a name in the wind. A figure who danced from place to place, always uninvited. Sometimes he accepted coin. Sometimes he didn’t. But he needed it to survive and move on. Whatever people paid him to remove, vanished. Dead, gone, or gods knew what… or how.</p>

                                <p>He never stayed long. No one wanted him to. Neither did he.</p>

                                <p>Then, for the first time in his life, he began to dream of something besides pitch black.</p>

                                <p>This time, it was… warmth. An alien sensation. One that soothed the growling within him and left only breath in its wake.</p>

                                <p>Like the others, he felt the pull. The presence that always walked alongside him no longer snarled, but it urged. Invited. Almost… hopeful. It wanted him to follow. And he for once found a purpose for moving forward other than just the sake of doing so.</p>

                                <p>So he did. It led him forward, and then it didn’t. One day, the path twisted, and he found himself in a place of mirrors. A circle. A trap. Each mirror showed a version of him, not a reflection. Each one wrong. Each one worse than the last. The breath inside him tried to flee. The presence clawed and gnashed, not at the mirrors, but at him. Urging him to run.</p>

                                <p>And then… Hands.</p>

                                <p>Real ones. Flesh. Warmth. Purpose. They pulled him out. He woke coughing sea brine and stone dust. Blood on his teeth. Light in his eyes. And them, already there. Already waiting. An elf wreathed in glory. A girl with eyes like drowned stars. A dwarf, tough as the mountain. A child of the forest.</p>

                                <p>He didn’t know their names. But he knew what they were. “Family.”</p>
