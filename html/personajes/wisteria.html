                                <h2>Wisteria</h2>
                                <p>Once, a woman full of grief made a pact. Her soul for a child.<br>
                                A forbidden act of magic. A child with no father. A child lacking that mandatory step of the natural order. A halfblood, not conceived, but conjured. Pulled into the world by a promise and aching want.</p>

                                <p>The pact took root.<br>
                                Nine months after, a mad sailor washed ashore, half-drowned and raving. The woman found him, tried to help, and he grabbed her, trapped her, and whispered into her ear. Not language, but knowledge, bitter and too vast, older than gods, and utterly unfit for the mortal mind. It cracked her wide open.<br>
                                She broke waters that same night. And then, she broke.</p>

                                <p>Screaming and laughing, she walked into the sea to drown herself mid-birth. The fishermen who found her were too late for the mother, but not the child.</p>

                                <p>Wisteria, they called her. Almost like the flower.</p>

                                <p>She was born gasping, with salt on her tongue. One eye slit like a serpent’s, the other fogged like deep tidewater. Her skin was always cold. Her silence, worse. And something had chosen her.<br>
                                People of the village called her cursed. A sea-born witch. Yet, she didn’t speak in her defense. She never needed to. She knew… They were right. Felt it.<br>
                                She could listen to the sea. To the arcane, that shifted and bent with the movement of her fingers. And her dreams… showed her things no one else could bear to see.</p>

                                <p>By the time she was grown, she knew too much. She made coin reading dreams, crafting wards, whispering names. They called her seer, witch, charlatan… But she never felt like home. Never truly built roots. The sea was always in her ears. And her dreams… they worsened. Tides rising. Shorelines breaking. A voice like water pressing against her skull, whispering soon.</p>

                                <p>Then, within her dreams, came the warmth. Recognition. As if something far away had finally seen her, called her, and for the first time in her life, she longed. For a place. For the others.</p>

                                <p>So she took passage on a trading vessel bound for the mainland.<br>
                                Through storm and shipwreck, through ashore with the wreckage, through an odyssey, she found them: Seth’themar and Vorna.<br>
                                It didn’t feel like a meeting.<br>
                                It felt like a return.<br>
                                Yet still, the dreams whispered.<br>
                                They weren’t complete.</p>
