                                <h2>Genevieve Du'Valcour</h2>
                                
                                <p>Genevieve Du’Valcour was born into privilege, the cherished daughter of a noble house known for its wealth and influence. She was raised among opulence, taught diplomacy, etiquette, and the virtues of leadership. But the gilded halls of her childhood hid a truth far darker than she could have imagined. The Du’Valcour name carried a secret, one that stained their legacy in blood. When Genevieve uncovered the horrors buried beneath her family’s respectable façade, her world was shattered. She could have turned a blind eye, played the role expected of her, but she refused. She abandoned her birthright, walked away from the life that had been laid out before her, and vowed to carve her own path—one defined by justice, not corruption.</p>

                                <p>Genevieve believes in doing good, in making the world a better place, but her past lingers like a shadow. She is not naïve. She knows that the world is not kind, that sometimes righteousness demands sacrifice. She is warm, charismatic, and carries herself with the confidence of a woman who has stood in the halls of power, but beneath that radiance is steel. She is willing to do what is necessary, even when the choices are difficult.</p>
                                
                                <p>Though she strives for justice, Genevieve does not always walk the path of a hero. The lines between right and wrong blur in the pursuit of something greater, and she is no stranger to compromise. Her past has given her an edge, an understanding of deception and power plays that she uses to her advantage. While she fights for something better, she knows that the world does not change through virtue alone.</p>
                                
                                <p>In battle, Genevieve is swift and precise, favoring a rapier and a dagger. Her movements are fluid, almost like a dance, a reflection of her noble upbringing and rigorous training. She does not fight with brute strength but with strategy and finesse, striking where it matters most.</p>
                                
                                <p>She carries her past with her, not as a burden but as a lesson. She is determined to prove that she is more than the name she left behind, that she can forge something new, something untainted. But the past is not so easily left behind, and the truth she uncovered still lingers, threatening to pull her back into the world she tried to escape.</p>
