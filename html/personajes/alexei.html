                                <h2>Alexei, the Bloodlust</h2>

                                <p>The one that fights because nothing else in this world makes him feel alive.</p>

                                <p>A towering juggernaut of muscle and ire, he is the Deathstalkers’ answer when the Triad requires strength. Stealth is never an option for him. He’s not the one to wait to creep in the dark, to hide between corners waiting for the perfect moment. He is the moment. He is the one that creates the openings, crashing through enemy lines like a force of nature.</p>

                                <p>Anger fuels him. Not a mindless rage, but something deeper, something insatiable, engraved in his mind after Father experimented on him. He thrives on the chase, on the thrill of battle, on the moment when his prey realizes there is no escape. Strategy bores him and hesitation disgusts him. He was made for war, and so long as there is blood to spill, Alexei will never be anything less than unstoppable.</p>

                                <p>Yet outside the battlefield, among his siblings, he is almost a different man. He is a good comrade, the kind to share a drink and a laugh, the first to clap a brother on the back after a mission well done. Around a fire, with a mug of ale in hand, he is the closest thing the Deathstalkers have to camaraderie. But there are lines that should never be crossed.</p>

                                <p>Because Alexei does not turn off.</p>

                                <p>That same unrelenting force that makes him a terror to his enemies makes him a danger to his allies outside of the Deathstalkers. There are whispers among the ranks, stories of those too slow to move, too foolish to stand in his way. When the Bloodlust takes hold, he does not always care who falls beneath his axe. Ally, foe, it doesn’t matter. If you are in his path, you are an obstacle, and this one does not stop for obstacles.</p>

                                <p>So drink with him, fight beside him, call him brother. Just never, ever test his patience. Never, ever poke him. Because once he sees red, there is no stopping him.</p>
