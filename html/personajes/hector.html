                                <h2>Hector, the Dreadflame</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Some men kill for coin. Others kill for duty.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hector kills because he likes it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is no rage in him. No thirst for revenge, no grand cause. Only a slow, creeping hunger, something cold and bottomless, something that cannot be filled no matter how much blood he spills.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Once, he had a name. A past. A life before the Deathstalkers. But Theron took that away. Burned it to ash. Left behind something better: a thing without hesitation, without mercy, without the weight of guilt or grief. He remembers nothing of who he was before the experiments. Only the now, only the orders given, the hunt, the kill, the thrill of watching something squirm beneath his fingers.
                                <p>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    Among the Deathstalkers, he is a presence that lingers too long at the edge of a battlefield, the quiet hum in a room that makes the air feel, ironically colder. He is a scholar of suffering, an artisan of agony. Hector does not simply kill, he studies pain, dissects it, refines it like an alchemist chasing perfection. He does not scream in battle, does not revel in the chaos like some of his kin. He watches. He waits. And then, when the time is right, he burns.
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Fire is his gift, his curse, his language. A whisper from his fingers can reduce a man to a wailing, blackened husk. A couple gestures can turn a village into a funeral pyre. He does not care for precision, for clean kills or quick deaths. He cares for ruin. Bridges collapse under his flames, battalions are swallowed whole, cities wake to the sound of crackling embers and the scent of charred flesh. Others in the Deathstalkers are more skilled, more precise, more disciplined. But none of them destroy like Hector. None of them leave behind the kind of devastation that makes even their own allies uneasy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Perhaps there was once something human in him. A time when he felt fear, love, sorrow. If so, it has long since burned away. Whatever remains now is something else entirely. Something hollow. Something insatiable. He does not remember the man he was before. But if he had the choice he wouldn’t want to.
                                </p>
