                                <h2>Dimitri, the Undying</h2>

                                <p>He’s been burnt. Drowned, crushed, torn limb from limb. And yet, he still walks.</p>

                                <p>His gift is simple on paper. It’s the undeath. He has been maimed and mutilated, reduced to broken bones and tattered flesh, but no matter what is done to him, he always comes back. The Triad sends him where no one else will go: suicide missions, impossible odds, and the jaws of certain death themselves, because for Dimitri, there is no such thing.</p>

                                <p>And yet, he is not whole. His body restores itself, but not perfectly. Scars linger where they shouldn’t, old wounds that refuse to fade. But there is one that never healed, one that defied his gift, a wound inflicted by a fearsome alchemist from the Land of Dawns. His missing eye. A mystery even to him. Perhaps, a reminder, one that there exists a way to truly hurt him.</p>

                                <p>But the wounds that never closed are not just on his flesh.</p>

                                <p>Dimitri has been "dead" so many times that something inside him broke along the way. His sense of humor is twisted, his mind cracked in ways no one can fully grasp. He does things that can make anybody uneasy. He pulls out his own nails for the sake of doing it, carves into his own skin with idle curiosity, watches with fascination as the wounds knit themselves shut. Maybe he does it to feel something, or maybe it’s simply one of the side effects of not being able to rest.</p>

                                <p>Make no mistake, though, he can fight. But what makes him truly horrifying is the simple, irrefutable fact that nothing you do will stop him.</p>

                                <p>So long as he is breathing, he will crawl from the wreckage, rise from the grave. He will come back, over and over again, until the mission is done, or until one of his Deathstalker siblings rescues his broken body.</p>

                                <p>Then he will rise, rinse, and repeat.</p>
