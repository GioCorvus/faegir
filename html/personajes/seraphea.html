                                <h2>Seraphea</h2>

                                <p>Seraphae was born into the sacred Order of the Veil, a sect devoted to the god of Death, where she was raised to guide lost souls to their final rest. From childhood, she was taught that death was not an end, but a transition, and that it was the duty of the Order to ensure that the balance remained undisturbed. She followed the teachings with quiet devotion, rising within the Order with a steadfast faith. But something changed. The spirits she once communed with began to reach for her in ways that defied the doctrine she had always known. They whispered truths the Order did not speak of, showed her visions that unsettled her very soul. The path she was meant to walk had shifted beneath her feet, and no one could tell her why.</p>

<p>One vision, more powerful than the rest, called her to the Elder Grove, a place where an entire druidic circle had been destroyed. She does not know why she was summoned there or what awaits her, only that the spirits have guided her toward it for a reason. Though her faith in the god of Death remains unshaken, she is beginning to understand that the Order does not have all the answers. She remains loyal, but the calling she follows now is not one dictated by them.</p>

<p>Seraphae is not a warrior in any sense. She carries no weapon beyond a ceremonial dagger meant for ritual, not for combat. Her power is in her sight, in the visions that come to her unbidden, in the knowledge that lingers just beyond her grasp. She does not fight; she endures. She moves through the world with quiet strength, commanding respect without seeking it. There is an air of mystery about her, a presence that makes her difficult to read and even harder to truly know.</p>

<p>She does not seek companionship, yet she does not reject it when it finds her. She knows the path before her is uncertain, that the truths she is uncovering may take her further from the Order than she ever wished to stray. But she will not turn away. She will face what is coming, even if it means standing alone in the end.</p>
