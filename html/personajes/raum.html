                                <h2>Raum</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Raum was always a quiet child. Watchful, deliberate, always protective of his twin sister in ways he rarely spoke aloud. Even as a boy, he carried a stillness that unsettled grown men.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But stillness didn’t mean softness. The twins were raised in hardship. The northern houses had long since turned on one another, brooding war and blood. Their family, led by Halgrim and Mileena, was outmatched, outnumbered, and cornered. So the noble pair did the unthinkable.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    They took their children and vanished beyond the Frozen Sea.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    It was a last resort born of desperation, and to the rest of the world, House Wyrnaryn died that day.
                                </p>    
                                <p>
                                    Years passed. Then Raum came back.
                                </p>  
                                <p>
                                    He was the first to emerge, no longer a boy, but something colder. Riding atop Morvahl, a dragon black as voidglass, Raum laid fire and ruin across the Northern Marches. He opened the way for the rest of his bloodline to follow.
                                </p>     
                                <p>
                                    It seems he was forged in places without mercy. Hardened by a world no tongue speak.
                                </p>    
                                <p>
                                    He is ruthless now. Efficient. Unshakable. He earned the Iceborn title. Others call him the Winter Fang. His voice cuts softer than steel but lands just as deep. Whole warbands have turned back at the sight of him: no threats, no speeches. Just the cold weight of his presence.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    Raum is not loud. He does not boast. But behind his silence, there is fire. And behind that fire, something far darker.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    What he became beyond the sea is a question few are brave enough to ask.    
                                </p>
