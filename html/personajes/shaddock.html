                                <h2>Shaddock, the Soulrender </h2>

                                <p>
                                    Shaddock is a man consumed by a singular, unyielding drive: perfection. To him, nothing exists but the need to be flawless. Whether it's the weapons he conjures from the ether or the battles he fights, every action must be executed with the utmost precision.But beneath the calm, calculating exterior, there is a quiet, insidious madness consuming his insides.
                                </p>
                                <p>           
                                    He is a battlemage: Shaddock is able to summon ethereal weapons, manifestations of his own will and mind. Swords, spears, whips, or shields, each one is an extension of his intent. In battle, every movement is executed like a choreography, every strike an execution of the calculated plan in his mind. But it’s not enough. It will never be enough.
                                </p>  
                                <p>        
                                    Perfection, for Shaddock, is not just a goal, it is an obsession. The chase for it is all consuming. Each success only drives him to push harder, faster, better. Anything less than perfection is a failure.
                                </p>     
                                <p>         
                                    When he falls short of his own expectations,  he punishes himself. His mind spirals into a dark place, and the perfectionist within him demands retribution. Broken knuckles, a whipped back. It’s a silent, internal torment, but one he cannot escape. His body is marked by these acts of self-punishment, like reminders of each mistake, each failure. It is as if the only way he can find balance is to destroy the very thing that caused him to slip up: himself.
                                </p>     
                                <p>         
                                    In combat, Shaddock is still coldly efficient, his weapons responding to his every command with accuracy. Yet, inside, there is a storm of frustration that only grows louder with each battle. A single missed swing feels like a devastating loss, and the growing pressure to be perfect begins to crack the edges of his mind. He compares himself to his siblings, he boils in rage when doing so. He is constantly chasing that idealized version of himself.. No matter how many battles he wins, no matter how many perfect strikes he lands, Shaddock never feels whole. 
                                </p>
                                <p>         
                                    He always feels less.
                                </p>
