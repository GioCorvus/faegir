                                <h2>Gaheris, the Cursed Blade</h2>

                                    <p>This one doesn’t make promises. He doesn’t have to. His reputation is enough.
                                         A man who hunts curses, slays monsters, and breaks the bonds of magic.
                                          But none of it comes without a price. His blonde, dirty hair frames a face 
                                          that tells the story of a life lived on the edge of something dark.
                                           The scars on his skin, the twisting dark veins running down his arms 
                                           and neck, are a reminder of a pact he never should have made. His eyes,
                                            once a bright blue, have dulled. They do not blink at the horrors they
                                             have seen, but sometimes, they hold a flicker of regret. Or perhaps,
                                              just resolve.</p>

                                    <p>He often wears different kinds of black armour, always worn and battered,
                                         its surfaces dull with age and battle. Chains of gold always hang from
                                          his chest, each one carrying a relic, glowing faintly with magic,
                                           tools for his trade. They are the last remnants of a faith he
                                            abandoned long ago, charms meant to ward off corruption.</p>

                                    <p>He is no knight, no hero. He does not fight for glory, nor does he fight
                                         to save anyone. Not anymore. He fights because it is all he knows,
                                          because monsters are easier to kill than men, because breaking curses
                                           is simpler than facing the past. The world has its tales, but Gaheris
                                            does not live for them. He is not the one people pray for. He is
                                             the one they turn to when there is no one left.</p>

                                    <p>There was once something else. Someone else. Blood in his veins binds
                                         him to a history that refuses to die. A name, buried in the ashes of
                                          the past. A mother who burned, a shadow cast over everything she left
                                           behind. And a brother, one who walks a different road, or perhaps,
                                            one whose path was never his to choose.</p>

                                    <p>There is magic inside of him, but it was never his ally.
                                         The curse dwells within him, a consequence of desperation, something
                                          that claimed more than he ever intended to give. It does not serve him,
                                           it does not protect him. But it has kept him alive long enough to finish
                                            the job, and that is all he asks of it. He does not believe in
                                             redemption. There is only the next hunt, the next curse to break,
                                              and when it is done, he will move on to the next. Because that is
                                               all he knows how to do.</p>

                            <p>
                                Gaheris is reserved, calculating, and fiercely 
                                independent. He speaks little, his words blunt and to the point.
                                There’s little patience
                                for weakness, but beneath his cold exterior lies weariness, born
                                from years in the trade. He no longer believes
                                in redemption, only survival, and the next hunt. Yet, despite the curse
                                that drags him down, something still burns within him like a flicker of
                                something long gone, buried beneath the years of wounds and broken faith.
