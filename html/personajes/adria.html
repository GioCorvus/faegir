                                <h2>Adria, the Sacred</h2>

                                <p>
                                Adria, "The Sacred," is as a beacon of hope, the guiding light
                                of the Golden Order and the Land of Dawns. She has led them since
                                the first rebellion, fighting with resolve, cutting down those
                                who threaten the Land of Dawns, earning the uttermost trust of
                                Gideon and becoming her right hand. Her sword severs the wicked,
                                her spear pierces sin just the same. To falter is to invite judgment.
                                To stray is to risk the blade.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                She protects the innocent with conviction, upholding the ideals of justice
                                and order. To the faithful, she is salvation. To the lost, she is a
                                path forward. And to those who would bring corruption: monsters,
                                criminals, those who defy the laws of the Order, she is death.
                                No hesitation in her strikes, no doubt in her judgment. She wields
                                righteousness as a weapon, delivering punishment as fiercely as she
                                once offered mercy.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                But the wars have been long, the crusades endless. She has seen too
                                many betrayals, too many second chances squandered. Where once she 
                                sought to guide, now she only cleanses. Where once she believed in redemption,
                                now she sees only risks. The line between guilt and innocence has blurred,
                                but Adria does not waver, because to waver is to let darkness take hold.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                She does not speak of it, not even to herself. But with every life she
                                takes, with every verdict passed in blood, something within her drifts
                                further from what she once was. The world still calls her righteous,
                                still looks to her as its savior. And perhaps she is. But salvation,
                                in her hands, is no longer gentle. It is fire and steel.
                                It is judgment with no room for doubt.
                                </p>
                                
                               
                        </div>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>

                            <p>
                                Adria is disciplined, focused, and unshaken. She carries herself with 
                                confidence and speaks with authority, expecting others to follow without
                                question. She values order, loyalty, and strength, showing little
                                patience for hesitation or weakness. Once, she was more compassionate,
                                willing to listen and understand, but bloodshed has made her sharp and
                                unforgiving. She suppresses doubt and emotions, believing they only
                                get in the way of duty. To those who earn her trust, she is steady
                                and dependable, but to those who oppose her, she is cold and
                                relentless. Though she still fights for what she believes is right,
                                the fire that once guided her has become something harsher, something
                                she no longer stops to question.
