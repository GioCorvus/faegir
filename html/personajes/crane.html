                                <h2>Crane, the Shade</h2>

                                <p> 
                                    Crane is the youngest of the Deathstalkers, although not by age, but by his behavior. An elf by nature, time doesn’t erode him like his kin, and it’s his playful, almost childish demeanor that sets him apart. Mischievous and prone to teasing, he’s often seen as the "prankster" of the group. His laughter, rare and unsettling, can break the heavy silence that hangs over the Deathstalkers’ halls.
                                </p>                                
                                <p>               
                                    His special ability to blend seamlessly into shadows makes him an unrivaled spy. Crane moves with the grace of a shadow, slipping in and out of places unseen, gathering secrets and leaving no trace behind. When the Triad requires intel, he’s the one they call. However, his love for the shadows goes beyond duty,  it’s where his true nature thrives. Crane enjoys hiding in plain sight, playing games with his siblings by disappearing right under their noses or reappearing at the worst possible moment to unsettle them. His tricks may be unsettling, but they are always expertly executed.
                                </p>                              
                                <p>          
                                    Despite his childish streak, Crane takes his missions seriously when the time comes, though his antics often blur the lines between playful distraction and serious work. His pranks can leave his fellow Deathstalkers either shaking their heads in annoyance or trying to figure out if they’ve been part of a joke they didn’t understand. He’s quick to push boundaries and hard to predict, never quite knowing when enough is enough, and sometimes his jokes take a darker turn.
                                </p>                           
                                <p>       
                                    Still,  Crane is a master of his craft. He can slip through the cracks and vanish into the night, unseen and unheard, making him an invaluable asset.
                                </p>
