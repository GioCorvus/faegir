                                <h2>Uther, the Wolf</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The white wolf prowls far beyond the north. Its claws reach farther than most realize, sharpened by years of survival in inhospitable lands. Battle has honed its fangs, each scar a testament to experience paid in blood.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uther is that wolf. The leader of the pack. The head of the Silver Fangs, the most formidable mercenary company in all of Fae'Gir.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Time has weathered him, but it has not dulled him. He carries the wisdom of age and the resilience of the north: unyielding, sharp, and deadly. War, subterfuge, strategy, steel… you name it, he’s mastered it. His company is the first choice for those who seek the best… or those who need the worst done. His reputation as a leader and tactician makes the Silver Fangs a force to be reckoned with across the realm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Forging an alliance built on ruthlessness and sealed with success is no small feat, but Uther has done it. His word is law within the company, not just by fear, but by the weight of earned respect. In a trade where few live long enough to grow old, he endures. And as long as he does, the Silver Fangs will thrive.
                                </p>

                                Uther personifies the cunning and ferocity that characterizes the northern lands. His temperament is as cold as the Marks that saw him born, but beneath that icy exterior hides a cunning strategist. He is a man of few words, whose eloquence manifests in lethal actions rather than empty speeches.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Uther's tenacity is his distinguishing trait; he persists where others falter, and his longevity in a profession where death is a constant companion speaks of his ability to navigate dangers. However, this tenacity often blends with calculated caution, demonstrating that every move is carefully weighed. Despite his intimidating appearance, Uther also harbors a sense of loyalty towards those who have proven their worth, forging an alliance where his word is law. Moreover, when circumstances allow, his northern blood makes him an excellent drinking companion.
                            </p>
