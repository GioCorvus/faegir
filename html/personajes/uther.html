                                <h2>Uther, the Wolf</h2>
                                <p>
                                    From the icy Northern Marks emerges Uther, a northerner whose being resembles the ferocity of a white wolf. With years of experience honed in the inhospitable lands, Uther stands as the undisputed leader of the Silver Fang Mercenaries, the most competent mercenary company in all of Fae'Gir.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uther, with his silver fur like steel and eyes that reflect the cunning of a predator, personifies the toughness forged in the Northern Marks. His skill in the art of war is unparalleled, consolidating the Silver Fangs as the preferred choice for those seeking the best in the dark world of Fae'Gir... or who simply want dirty work done. His reputation as an uncompromising leader and exceptional strategist has made his mercenaries a force throughout the realm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Weaving an alliance rooted in the lack of scruples and marked by success is an extraordinary achievement in the lands where history unfolds. In this murky setting, Uther's word outweighs that of any other within the company. His tenacity has made him a veteran in a trade where youth often succumbs.
                                </p>

                                Uther personifies the cunning and ferocity that characterizes the northern lands. His temperament is as cold as the Marks that saw him born, but beneath that icy exterior hides a cunning strategist. He is a man of few words, whose eloquence manifests in lethal actions rather than empty speeches.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Uther's tenacity is his distinguishing trait; he persists where others falter, and his longevity in a profession where death is a constant companion speaks of his ability to navigate dangers. However, this tenacity often blends with calculated caution, demonstrating that every move is carefully weighed. Despite his intimidating appearance, Uther also harbors a sense of loyalty towards those who have proven their worth, forging an alliance where his word is law. Moreover, when circumstances allow, his northern blood makes him an excellent drinking companion.
