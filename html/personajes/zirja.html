                                <h2>Zirja</h2>
                                <p>They escaped together under stormlight and smoke. He was beastkin, marked with scars from collar chains. And so was she, pregnant, bleeding from the wrists where they had cut the brand off her. Slaves. Years of it, of pain, of endurance. They ran until the roads vanished, past villages, past fences, until the forest swallowed them whole.</p>

                                <p>He held her through the contractions in a clearing bathed in moonlight. He whispered old songs to calm her, but the wind was louder. She screamed, and the animals came. A congregation of fang and antler, wing and eye. They formed a circle as the child was born, watching. Almost… protecting.</p>

                                <p>She was called Zirja. And the moment she drew breath, her father wept, and the animals never left their side.</p>

                                <p>He died three nights later, from a wound too deep, rusted with dirt and iron. Her mother buried him beneath the roots of a blackened cedar. She did not cry. She just held the child close and whispered the songs alone.</p>

                                <p>Zirja grew among wet leaves and the wilderness. Her hands knew herbs before names. Birds landed on her shoulders. Sick creatures crawled into her arms and walked away whole. She could feel the light humming. She didn’t know faith, yet somehow, she felt it. The power of mending, of healing. The welcome warmth that moved through her veins whenever she placed her hands on a wound or an illness.</p>

                                <p>When they wandered south, her mother tried to raise her among others. But no matter how many lives Zirja saved, no matter how she healed the blind or soothed the dying, they never stopped seeing her ears. Her claws. Her fur. Her silence.</p>

                                <p>Beastkin. Wildblood. Witch. Monster.</p>

                                <p>Eventually, she stopped staying. A beastkin? With magic? The voices never stopped whispering. Her mother had it hard enough, just for being wildblood. But Zirja had it worse.</p>

                                <p>So she left.</p>

                                <p>She turned her feet north and east, into the places where even the bitterest winters and sharpest-fanged monsters roamed like wildlife. Still, she walked. She gave what help she could, never asking for thanks. Years spent in churches, in helpless villages, with traveling caravans…</p>

                                <p>And then one day, she felt it. The call.</p>

                                <p>And the others came to her slowly. Or maybe, she came to them.</p>

                                <p>Wisteria. Vorna. Seth’themar. When she saw them, she knew them. She felt it, that warmth, that familiarity.</p>

                                <p>From that moment on, she stayed close to that warmth. She prayed in languages she had never learned. She healed her companions with magic, or herbs, when magic faltered. Yet the voice of the forest still lingered in her blood. Something old still followed her steps.</p>

                                <p>A cleric, yes. But one shaped by the wilds.</p>
