                                <h2>Vorna</h2>
                                <p>Vorna was born beneath a mountain’s crushing weight. Her mother trapped under rock and ice for days, refusing to die until the child was born. She refused oblivion until the child came screaming into the cold. When they dug them free, the newborn already had blood on her fists.</p>

                                <p>Among dwarves, Vorna was never the loudest, but gods help anyone who tried to move her. She was a wall from the beginning. Strong bones, scarred young, and too stubborn to yield even when she should have. Others trained with precision and discipline, Vorna trained for impact, breaking shields with her own and knocking giants from their saddles like loose teeth. She never flinched, and never backed down.</p>

                                <p>She fought in the pit-trials of her people and never once fell. They said she was like the mountain that bore her: unyielding and unmovable.</p>

                                <p>In the mountain holds, when halls cracked and clans fought over the scraps, Vorna stood in the breach. She didn't need to give speeches: Instead, she made lines, and dared the enemy to cross them.</p>

                                <p>Her name even escaped the dark depths of the dwarven holds, and it did so as whispers of one who held gates when no one else could. Who spat blood and kept swinging. Who led her kin because no one could bear to let her fight alone.</p>

                                <p>Then came the siege. Seth’themar, the winged warlord, bringing rain of arrows and fire. His army surrounded the hold. His tactics were flawless, except for the part where she walked out alone.</p>

                                <p>She met him on a ledge above the siege line, challenged him. Of course, he accepted.</p>

                                <p>Her shield shattered. Her side split open. But she drove him into the stone and broke his bow arm beneath her boot, his ribs under her strength.</p>

                                <p>Then… Familiarity. No words. Just the feeling of meeting a brother she hadn't known she’d lost.</p>

                                <p>They didn’t talk about it. They just fought side by side from then on.</p>

                                <p>Some time after, they both felt it: a dream shared, vivid and undeniable. A relentless pull from beyond the known world. Far too real to ignore. And so, they followed, across scorched fields and roads, chasing the echo of three others who had yet to be found.</p>
